Project by: Alma Ordaz

Descriptions: This project includes two ways to encode/decode a phrase. CesarCipher will output all possible ways to either encode or decode the given lowercase word. VigenereCipher will output the encoded word by adding the key and will output the decoded word when subtracting the key.
