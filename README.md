## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).




Project by: Alma Ordaz

Descriptions: This project includes two ways to encode/decode a phrase. CesarCipher will output all possible ways to either encode or decode
              the given lowercase word. VigenereCipher will output the encoded word by adding the key and will output the decoded word when subtracting the key.
